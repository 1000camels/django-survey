# Django survey

Using the admin interface you can create surveys, add questions, give questions
categories, and mark them as required or not. The front-end survey view then
automatically populates based on the questions that have been defined and
published in the admin interface.

Submitted responses can also be viewed via the admin backend. 


## Getting started


In order to get started, install the requirements, create the database, create
a superuser, launch the server, then create your survey in the django admin :

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py createsuperuser
	python manage.py runserver
	# Create survey in interface

You will have to change the settings in order to suit your need.

# Credits

some inspiration came from an older
[django-survey](https://github.com/flynnguy/django-survey) app, but this app
uses a different model architecture and different mechanism for dynamic form
generation.
